### Three conditions to invest energy in this mastermind

1. Be surrounded by people in different industries.
2. Attend the Master Mind Group every 1 or 2 weeks.

### What is a Master Mind Group?

It’s the coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony. « When we listen to the advice of other smart people, who want to help you, you will be at an economic advantage. »
